# Supabase Auth - Chrome Extension

This is a fork of RustyZone's Supabase Auth Chrome Extension. This is a working demo extension that allows one to:
1. Create a user account using Supabase Auth
2. Login to Supabase Auth using the created account

Rusty created a [YouTube tutorial explaining the original Supabase Auth extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7eM_nXgJ4&t=169s) you may want to watch.

# Instructions
Change your Supabase details in bg-supa.js and manifest.json to fit your Supabase API details.
